The total mining reward is 1,000,000 LRC, 33,333 LRC each day.\n3. You can withdraw LRC, ETH, WBTC, USDT, USDC, and DAI from custodial platforms to Loopring Wallet to join the mining program.\n4. To qualify, the total value of your wallet balance shall be no less than 100 USD. Rewards are based on your daily balances.\n5. Users who paid to create a wallet (bought a short ENS or \'special\' address), OR users who have created a wallet before midnight Beijing time on November 27th will earn a double reward.\n6. LRC will earn a double reward.\n7. Assets on Loopring 3.6\'s layer-2 account will earn a double reward.\n8. Wallets with three or more Guardians will earn a double reward.\n9. The above doubles can be \'stacked\' (multiplied) but are capped at 8X. Each wallet\'s effective participation amount is limited to 800,000 USD.\n10. We will randomly select a time every day to take a snapshot and calculate the reward based on your effective participation amount.\n11. We will distribute LRC rewards directly to your wallet\'s layer-2 account the next day.\n12. This program only supports Loopring Wallets that are on the new Loopring 3.6 protocol (If you create a wallet before Nov 27th, you can one-click migrate. All wallets created after Nov 27th are on v3.6 by default.) While the spirit of this program is to incentivize users to take control away from CEXs, assets coming from anywhere, including other self-custodial wallets are eligible.\n13.

    <string name="arbitrum_how_to_work">How does Arbitrum work?</string>
    <string name="arbitrum_how_to_work_msg">The Arbitrum compiler takes your Solidity contracts and compiles them to run on Arbitrum. The EthBridge connects Arbitrum-land with Ethereum-land, letting you communicate and pass ether and tokens back and forth. Your Arbitrum code is run by validators, whom you choose. Your contract will run correctly if even one of your chosen validators is honest — that’s the AnyTrust guarantee. All of this can happen quickly and mostly off-chain.</string>
    <string name="arbitrum_additional_benefits">Additional benefits</string>
    <string name="arbitrum_additional_benefits_msg">Arbitrum is compatible with Ethereum. Arbitrum makes your DApp scalable, by moving almost all of its activity off-chain and making your DApp\'s cost independent of the size of its code and data. Arbitrum also preserves privacy by letting you choose who gets to see what your DApp is doing. And Arbitrum gives you confidence in your DApp\'s correctness due to the AnyTrust Guarantee which lets you pick your validators and requires only one honest validator to ensure correct behavior.</string>

    <string name="eth_staking_lido_notice_content">Lido is a liquid staking solution for ETH 2.0 backed by industry-leading staking providers. Lido lets users stake their ETH - without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure.\n\nWhen using Lido to stake your ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain, users will receive a token (stETH), which represents their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain on a 1:1 basis. It effectively acts as a bridge bringing ETH 2.0’s staking rewards to ETH 1.0.\n\nWSTETH is the wrapped version of stETH. The total amount of WSTETH doesn’t change after users receive the token. Instead, the token’s value increases over time to reflect ETH staking rewards earned.</string>
    <string name="eth_staking_lido_risk_warning">It is important to note that users can\'t redeem WSTETH for ETH until phase 2 of Ethereum 2.0. However, users are able to trade WSTETH for ETH on various exchanges at market price.\n\nLoopring will provide a pool to allow users to trade WSTETH for ETH directly on Layer 2. The pool will rebalance periodically when it reaches a specific threshold. If there is not enough inventory on L2, users can always withdraw their WSTETH tokens to Layer 1 and swap for ETH in Lido, Curve, or 1inch.</string>
